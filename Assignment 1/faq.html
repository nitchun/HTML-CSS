			<dl>
				<dt class="dt1">WHEN WILL MY ORDER SHIP?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">Orders are usually processed and shipped within 3-5 business days (M-F) of purchase. Shipping time for custom/handmade pieces may take longer, details of which can be found in the product description. When your order ships, we will email you a shipping confirmation with tracking information. Please check your spam folder if you did not receive the shipping email.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt class="dt1">WHO DO I CONTACT FOR PRESS INQUIRIES?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">For all press inquiries email nithyasjewellery@xyz.com</dd>
				<br>
				<dt class="dt1">THROUGH WHAT CARRIER DO YOUR ORDERS SHIP?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">All U.S. orders are shipped via USPS First Class or Priority mail, UPS Ground or Air.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt class="dt1">DO YOU SHIP INTERNATIONALLY?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">Yes, to select countries. Click HERE to see our International Order policy. Prices displayed on the website are exclusive of shipping and taxes. All relevant import taxes and duties will be included in the final purchase price. We offer FREE shipping/duties on orders over $150, after discounts are applied.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt class="dt1">I JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER, BUT I’D LIKE TO RETURN PART OF IT. DO YOU ACCEPT RETURNS?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">Of course! We love experimenting with jewelry, and we understand that you might occasionally change your mind. You can send most unworn pieces back within 20-days of the ship date for a full refund or credit. All tags must be attached. Please include your original invoice with your return, and note the reason for return. Without order information, we will be unable to process your return. Please note: Personalized styles are final sale only. Also, if you received a free gift with purchase, make sure to send it back with the return or the retail value of the gift will be deducted from your refund.</dd>

				<dd class="dd1">We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt class="dt1">WHY WAS MY CREDIT CARD DECLINED?</dt>
				<dd class="dd1">Most credit cards are declined because the billing address you entered does not match the address your bank has on file. Please be sure to double check this, and if that does not work, please send us an email at nithyasjewellery@xyz.com</dd>
